# qb-lottery
Lottery resource for QB. Set to automatically determine a winner every 14 days. Basically a money sink that allows players to purchase tickets, and the total amount goes into a fund. On the 14th day the winning number is chosen. If someone has that ticket they will receive 50% of the total, and the other 50% will go to a government job.
